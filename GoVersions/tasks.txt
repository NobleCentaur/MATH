Steps to spread processes across multiple devices

1. establish a connection from master node to worker nodes
    a. workers start by listening for incoming connections
    b. main attempts to connect to listening worker node
    c. sends initial message for verification
    d. worker responds with same key (or differnet if we're feeling secure)
2. communicate parameters to all workers
    a. imageSize
    b. startingX
    c. startingY
    b. valuerange
        ba. need to compute step value from these
3. distribute row responsibility to every worker node
    a. start a new goroutine for each worker node on main
        aa. pick from a list of available rows to compute
        ab. send that row to the worker node
        ac. wait for response from worker
